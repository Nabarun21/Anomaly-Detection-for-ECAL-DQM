# Anomaly-Detection-for-ECAL-DQM
Code for supervised and semi-supervised (conv. autoencoder) based anomal detection system study for images of CMS electromagnetic calorimeter Data Quality Monitoring system

This repository houses code code for a study that I did stydying supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques for anomaly detection system for the data quality monitoring system for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment positioned at CERN's LHC. Look at slides linked here: https://github.com/Nabarun21/Anomaly-Detection-for-ECAL-DQM/blob/master/28022016_ADforECAL_CMS_MLForum_Nab.pdf


This study was presented at Computing for High Energy Physics Conference 2018, as an application for integrating deep learning techniques into the CMS DQM pipeline with collaboration with industry partners.(http://chep2018.org/). Proceeding based on the presentation will be out soon and linked here.
