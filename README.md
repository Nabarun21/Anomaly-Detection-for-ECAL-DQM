# Anomaly-Detection-for-ECAL-DQM
Code for supervised and semi-supervised (conv. autoencoder) based anomal detection system study for images of CMS electromagnetic calorimeter Data Quality Monitoring system

This repository houses code code for a case study that I did stydying supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques for anomaly detection system for the data quality monitoring system for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment positioned at CERN's LHC.
